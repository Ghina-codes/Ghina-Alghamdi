## 🎯 The Mission: 100 AI Projects Challenge

I'm currently building **100 artificial intelligence projects** in 1 year.  
Each one is a real concept: from data cleaning to model prediction and beyond.  
You can follow the journey 👉 [100-AI-Projects](https://github.com/Ghina-codes/100-ai-projects)

## ✨ Side Experiments

Not every brilliant idea fits inside the main challenge —  
So I create **side projects** to explore math, logic, and AI building blocks in a fun & visual way.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ Real AI models with clear steps  
- 🛠️ Visual demos (vectors, transformations, dot products…)  
- 🔁 Step-by-step projects from data to deployment  
- 💡 Personalized tools that solve actual problems
